# 2024-UK-Election-under-a-different-Electoral-System

Election data fascinates me, and I find the conversation around the performance of parties in different regions very interesting. I also enjoy learning about the different electoral systems used around the world. We use first-past-the-post in Canada, but recently I've felt a bit disgruntled with this system. Whether the disgruntlement is valid or not, I thought it would interesting to look at a recent election under the FPTP system and see what the results would like under a different system. 

Electoral-System.html contains the documented process. I made the document using RMarkdown, and all the code can be found on Electoral System.Rmd . uk_election_simulation.R contains R code from the RMarkdown file


## Disclaimers:

The data I used is publicly available on the U.K House of Commons website https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10009/ . This data is not enough when it comes to making big decisions about electoral systems. Should the electoral system ever be changed, the people in charge of it would have access to more data to make such significant decisions. Dividing the U.K into 12 constituencies is an example of this- 12 is likely too small of a number, and the only reason I chose that number was because it was available in the data. 

Furthermore, such changes would be guided by many experts in various fields. I do not know enough about political science or the United Kingdom to be qualified enough to talk about the British electoral system. I only made inferences based on the data I saw. In reality, the analysis would be far more complex and advanced than I could imagine. I must have made a lot of mistakes, and it is possible that my understanding of the electoral systems themselves are misguided.
